This ux is not right. 

I actually like the previous way of how clicking an image would get the scaffold, and then you could enter the link over there, or upload over there. That was niceer than the current alert system

And when I'm trying to give an image link It's not automatically rendering that image. Rather, I have to click on the image and then it works. If it's a precise image link, or a markdown format image, then it should straight show that

so the image button should give that same scaffold type shi

and the slash command is not necessary for images
